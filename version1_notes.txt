things to fix:

Frontend
1. deck should reassign values when card is placed into library from other zone, card stays on top, also re orders after shuffle
2. create pass turn button that un-taps other players lands and draw card
3. tutor by card name-DONE
4. fix shuffle mechanism so it doesn't reset after you shuffle and then draw a card
5. include loyalty property in card and display LOYALTY number as counter value IF NOT NONE
5. move cards to opponent battlefield
7. create exile/command zone
8. Tokens need more work-DONE
9. Fix annoying Tap/View Card - I think Fixed.
10. Make easier to view card.
11. option to execute action or tap on hover.
12. Make cards bigger if less on board.

Midddleware
1. add nodejs/express to handle request functionality such as creating and choosing deck from webpage to mongodb then serve to firebase
   - Do we need node/express? Can you make an api with python? Because I can make services with angular to send Get and Post requests.

Backend
1. image urls that don't work -DONE
2. generate more decks
3. Somehow introduce machine learning to create optimal decks - $$ potential haha.
4. Somehow turn a deck from tappedout into a deck here. ( Just an Idea )
