things to fix:

Frontend
1.deck should reassign values when card is placed into library from other zone, card stays on top, also re orders after shuffel
2.create pass turn button that untaps other players lands and draw card
3.tutor by card name-DONE
4.fix shuffel mechanism so it doesnt reset after you shuffel and then draw a card
5.include loyalty property in card and display LOYALTY number as counTer value IF NOT NONE
5.move cards to opponent battlefield
7.create exile/command zone
8.Tokens need more work-DONE

Midddleware
1. add nodejs/express to handle request functionailty such as creating and choosing deck from webpage to mongodb then serve to firebase
   - Do we need node/express? Can you make an api with python? Because I can make services with angular to send Get and Post requests.

Backend
1.image urls that don't work -DONE
2.generate more decks
